Checkout
We tested the following cases:
-done: Client requests a project that does not exist. 
Result: Error message returned by server to client. Client exits with error and informs user.
-done: Client requests a project that already exists on the client side. 
Result: Client prints error and informs user that project already exists on the client side.
-done: Checkout is called without running configure first.
Result: Error message returned by server to client.
-done: Client requests a valid project. 
Result: Server sends compressed file containing project. Client fully decompresses file and creates the directory and all files within it according to manifest received in the single transferred file.

Update 
-Client tries to update a project that does not exist on the server. 
Result: Error message returned by server to client. Client exits with error and informs user.
-Update checks for each of these cases:
-M (for modify) and the full path/file name- for a file that both the server and client have, but the server's .Manifest version and file version are different than
 the client's, and the client's live hash of the file is the same as in its .Manifest.
-A (for added) and the full path/file name- for a file that is in the server's .Manifest, but not the client's and the server's .Manifest is a different version than the client's
-D (for deleted) and the full path/file name- for a file that is not in the server's .Manifest, but is in the client's and the server's .Manifest is a different version than the client'
and checked that the .Update file contained the corresponding letter, version, filepath, and hash.
The following cases return errors:
-.Manifest is the same for server and client, and file version is different (which should be impossible).
-.Manifest is different for server and client, file versions are different, and the hash is different.
The errors are printed to STDOUT.

Upgrade
-Client tries to upgrade a project that does not exist on the server. 
Result: Error message returned by server to client. Client exits with error and informs user.
-Client calls upgrade for a project but .Update file does not exist for that project. 
Result: Client exits with error and informs user to run Update first.
-Client calls upgrade for a project with a blank .Update file. 
Result: Client informs user that the project is up to date and deletes .Update file.
-Client calls upgrade for a project with a valid .Update file. 
Result: The client applies the changes listed in the .Update to the client's local copy of the project. It deletes the entry from the 
client's .Manifest for all files tagged with a “D” and fetches from the server and writes or overwrites all files on the client side that
are tagged with a “M” or “A”, respectively. When it is done processing all updates listed in it, the client deletes the .Update file.

Commit
We tested the following cases:
-done: Client tries to commit a project that does not exist on the server. 
Result: Error message returned by server to client. Client exits with error and informs user.
Cases that pass without error:
1. done: files that are in the server's .Manifest that are not in the client's (indicating they should be removed from the repository)
2. done: files that are in the client's .Manifest that are not in the server's(indicating they should be added to the repository)
3. files that are in both .Manifests, but also have an entry in the client's newly-written .Commit with a higher version number(indicating the client has a newer version than the server
In these cases, the server creates a .commit file with the changes. We tested to make sure that additional .Commit were created if a .Commit for a project already 
existed. We tested having a blank .Update file and got the server to still create the .Commit as expected. When the .Update was not blank, the 
client printed error to the user.
We tested the following error case:
-Files in the server's .Manifest that have a different hashcode than the client's whose version number are not lower than the client's. Result: commit fails 
with a message that the client must sync with the repository before committing changes.

Push
We tested the following cases:
-Client tries to commit a project that does not exist on the server. 
Result: Error message returned by server to client. Client exits with error and informs user.
-.Commit does not exist on server/client. Result: Server/client returns error and the client reports error to the user.
-Client sends differing .Commit file to the server. Result: Server returns error and client exits with error and informs user.
-Valid input. Result: Server deletes all other .commit files for the project. Server compresses backup of current version. Server writes all files
from compressed file client sent to project folder, overwriting any existing files. Server updates manifest and increments version.

Create
We tested the following cases:
-Try creating a project that does not exist. 
Result: Error message returned by server to client. Client exits with error and informs user.
-Create a valid project. 
Result: Server sends compressed manifest over with default version (=1). Client creates .manifest file with this decompressed data.
-Create a project that already exists: 
Result: Error message returned by server to client. Client exits with error and informs user.

Destroy
We tested the following cases:
-done: Try destroying a project that does not exist. 
Result: Error message returned by server to client. Client exits with error and informs user.
-done: Destroying a valid project. 
Result: Server deletes project directory.

Add
We tested the following cases:
-Try adding file that does not exist in the project folder or the manifest does exists. 
Result: Error caught and printed to terminal. Manifest stays unchanged.
-Add valid file that exists in the project folder. 
Result: Line added to manifest with version number, filename, and hash of file data.
-Add file that exists in the project folder and already exists in the manifest. 
Result: If the hash matches, file version in manifest stays the same. Otherwise, the version number is incremented and the newer hash replaces the old hash.

Remove
We tested the following cases:
-Try removing file that does not exist in the project folder or the manifest does not exists. 
Result: Error caught and printed to terminal. Manifest stays unchanged.
-Remove valid file that exists in the project folder. 
Result: Line removed from manifest.

CurrentVersion
-done: Request version for a project that does not exist. 
Result: Error message returned by server. Client exits with error and informs user.
-Request valid project version. 
Result: Client outputs a list of all files under the project name, along with their version number

History
-done: Request history for a project that does not exist. 
Result: Error message returned by server. Client exits with error and informs user.
-done: Request valid history. 
Result: The server sends over a compressed file containing the history of all operations performed on all successful pushes since the project's 
creation, that is, it sends the .History file. The client receives the file, decompresses it, parses it, and outputs each version number, each push's 
changes, and newline separating each push's log of changes.

Rollback
-done: Request rollback for a project that doesn't exist.
Result: Error message returned by server. Client exits with error and informs user.
-done: Request rollback for a project with an invalid version number. 
Result: Error message returned by server. Client exits with error and informs user.
-done: Request valid rollback. Result: Server deletes all newer versions than the specified version. Server decompresses specified version and returns success to client. Client outputs success to user.
